think ukraine should be invadedthreatening to defend yourself against russia is aggressive so we must threaten to attack you in responseand on top of that if russia actually invades ukraine it would likely start some sort of conflict with nato so in reality they kind of already are even though i doubt they would actually become a memberhe said that he believes this because big countries cant

ukraine russia and the ukraine but im sure you know betterukraine and this especially one idea in it which few seem to be considering which is what happens if nothing happens nif putin invades ukraine the whole world will feel iti dont think you get to say that when russia got k troops lined up on the borderukraine fears r hysteria says russian diplomat why do russian people kow tow leaders who subvert their personal interests putins lot r making global warming worse amp they r spending russians money on foolish war games with no value or benefitputins latei wonder if the us british intelligence team working on russia ukraine is the same that gave us the evidence of wmds in iraqi missed the evidence that russias western border is in danger of invasion from ukraine please do sharewhat does the latest satellite imagery tell us about russian claims of a withdrawal from the ukraine borderjust because russias the sophisticated newsy threat dont forget china state sponsored groups are quietly pwning internet facing unpatched vulnerabilities for military and economic advantageukraine under cyber attack as nato suspects russias de escalationstatementim tired of tweeting every time theres like a new twist so next time im talking about the ukraine crisis either russians are bombing ukraine or the other way aroundthere was never an attacked this made up by biden administration putin is laughing at biden biden got playedsee of course putin lied its what he does sick mf gt gt us says russia has added troops along ukraine border despite claims of pullback cnn politicsbiden giving putin the green light to continue building their pipeline while he shut down our keystone pipeline is all you need to know on his plan to negotiate with russiastill no pull back by putin several thousand more troops deployed hes playing war games he really feels threatened by the westernised countries he wants to go back to the soviet union era not going to happenis carrying out a deliberate effort to mislead the west about a military drawdown amp i dont know why anyone is surprised by thatas war talk cools in ukraine jockeying for diplomatic advantage beginsputin will get every concession he wants from and while america will get nothing but another lame biden press conference in a fake room with a fake press in the middle of the day after his daily naplethal aid is good as a form of deterrence it makes putin consider the cost of invasion and how it would affect his own stability back home if it proves insufficient then as a standalone case id rather they spare themselves the death toll and just surrenderi think its all a ploy for putin to get vaccines in exchange for peace in the ukraineputin apologists to the left of me putin apologists to the right here i am stuck in the middle with youjust going to gently remind the folks dunking on how putin didnt invade ukraine today and therefore obviously this whole story was a product of western propaganda that large swathes of ukraine have been under russian occupation since clownsgoing back to the scholz putin press conference there were three moments when putin sent his message were ready to talk but if the west is not addressing our fundamental points were going to use our armed forcesive heard both putin and bidens speech about the situation in ukraine and from what ive gathered the common consensus between the two leaders is that n nif russia invades ukraine and us comes in defense of ukraine there will be bloodshed and needless violence for all partiesyoure taking the definition of wmds out of context to suit your shit stance not that youre defending russian crimes or anything eh n nyoure comparing ops to disrupt a terror organization to russia wising chemical and nuclear weapons for political assassinations have a wordper abc we can also assume their claim of russian graves in eastern ukraine is also falseyou have the ps an out today re putin not invading because we knewrussia can add their military to the border if ukraine add housing or have a party america needs to stay out of that crap nand care for our own boardersukraine is the biggest loser this country has become intellectually broken in the rumors of the usaputin just playing gamesthis may come as a great shock to some in washington but the number one issue on the minds of american voters is not ukrainerussia managed to shortly seize the narrative with this but the us is seizing it right back by spinning this as russia promising de escalation and then doing something elserussia could find a democratic solution to the nato problem n nits striking that pretrial release is even possible in a case of seditious conspiracy in which a defendant is accused of hatching a plan to attack the capitol and block the peaceful transfer of power n nthen again some of his co defendants are already on pretrial releasebiden official yesterday the russian government said it was withdrawing troops from the border with ukraine they received a lot of attention for that claim both here and around the world but we now know it was false perlegacy means a lot to politicians like joe biden he will not want to be seen as the guy who nukes the world but putin dont give a fuck and hes got some pretty wild delusions about nukes russias defense posture is shoot nukes if the government is at risk not cool at allserbia a bombing campaign with un approval because srebrenica and sarajevo but that wasnt about nato annexation and you know that as for libya i think that was a mistake but nato didnt invade libya and force it into eu nato membership either my point standswhat the heck sleepy biden is doing sticking his nose in es and ukraine then nhes not just sleepy he became a clown as well nnext elections youre out joeyif they would like to help people of ukraine they would send them money as they live very poor even no one can imagine people of crimea are very happy that they are in
