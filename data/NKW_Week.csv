taz3fdkxfmY,"{""commentId"": ""UgwM-8xFHWyg39yHKBp4AaABAg"" ""text"": ""As a physician who followed closely the development of Covid-19 or Corona pandemic I believe that we are dealing with the largest malpractice case in global medicine. Medical care must be evidence based. There is no scientific evidence that masks distancing shutdowns and hand washing cure the pandemic or prevent the spread of the disease. It 'flattens the curve\"" which actually means it delays the spread of the virus. Dr. Fauci became Robin hood and opinions of physicians with different opinions were crushed by the media. No second opinion allowed. The methods described were adopted from experience in 1918 and the Chinese recommendations as the pandemic grew. Was it \""common sense\"" not science which guided them? US had its experience with the pandemic of 2009 the \""swine flu\"" or H1N1. President Obama listened to his advisor Dr. Fauci and did not order a shut down masking distancing and washing hands and the economy was not closed and schools continues to operate even though the H1N1 virus attacks children 100 times more than Covid-19. President Obama ordered to stop counting the \""positives\"" and stop telling the public how many died. With all the sacrifices that Americans made at the advice of bureaucrats who never saw a patient nobody tells us if indeed the number of fatalities and morbidity decreased. Side effects of the above measures were never considered. What does ruining US economy mean? Poverty related death before Covid-19 were about 120000/year. Are the riots and civil unrest related to prolonged shutdowns? Is anybody interested in prolonged civil unrest looting setting businesses on fire and destroying monuments? More face masks are not a panacea and WHO doubted their use but immediately overruled by the global lobby which was interested to create a symbol of globalism as face masks have marginal value at the most. The story of Hydroxychloroquine is the story of the gross medical malpractice when tens of thousands died without being treated. Dr. Fauci had in 2005 evidence in his lab that HCQ is effective in curing and preventing Covid-19. He dismissed the drug while evidence is mounting that the drug is effective in global studies. For the first time in the history of medicine physicians were forbidden of treating their patients as they felt necessarily. The pros of treating with HCQ exceed by far the cons. Trashing a medication while there is no alternative is morally wrong and against physician's Hippocratic oath. Why did it happen? Misrepresentation: Testing \""positive\"" does not mean that you are a Corona patient. Most who test \""positive\"" are asymptomatic and only 1.02% of those die. The public must be aware that without autopsies the cause of death is presumptive. Most are correct but many are not. In US very few autopsies were done on patients who died presumably of Covid-19. There are 13 million Americans who tested \""positive\"" for Tuberculosis and we did not declare a \""pandemic\"".   The media turned every journalist to an expert and high-tech companies Google do not allow descent opinions. Fear was installed in America and the psychological impact especially in children will\r\nbe felt for years. The idea that if you send your kid to school you send him to be slaughtered is negated by worldwide studies. With 20000 children dying annually in motor vehicular accidents the greatest danger to kids is driving them to school.  -Isaac Barr MD""}",MSNBC,2020-09-14,Trump Defies Virus Restrictions With Indoor Rally In Nevada | Morning Joe | MSNBC,The president on Sunday held a campaign rally indoors in Nevada at a manufacturing facility in defiance of the state's ban on local gatherings of 50 people or more.
