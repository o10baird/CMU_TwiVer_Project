That was absolutely disgusting but you fools will sweep these events under the carpet because you know the blood is on your hands. The future generations will look back on us as being corrupt and delusional. I\u2019m so ashamed. \n\nWhat else on Je Je Joe? \n\n-the media celebrated when he lasted an hour in a media scrum.. He\u2019s the president and these are the things people celebrate with this clown. Yes that\u2019s the standard! \n-Compared George Floyd with Martin Luther King \n-Defund the police mess - no staff to protect our streets \n-all time high intentional law enforcement staff murders \n-Build back better collapse \n-Clearly unwell and senile \n-All-time high in crime nationally. 2021 closed with most homicides ever in history \n-Evidence of him and his son doing backhand deals - not to mention the quid pro quo with Ukraine. There\u2019s No surprise Russia sniffing around the border getting ready to invade \n-vaccine mandate will be rejected by high court\n-Afghanistan embarrassment - abandoning your allies like rats. The people who have stood by the US through thick and thin. What a Dog act and a representation of a coward \n-Inflation is the worst in 40 years \n-Can\u2019t remember the Australian prime minister name\n-Killed power Independence - fuel prices \n-Ruined relations with France over submarines deal\n-Russian border about irrupt into war and are likely to invade Ukraine & Kazakhstan \n-he basically gave Russia the green light to invade\n-The US Mexican border is a humanitarian crisis \n-Covid completely unmanaged - no testing kits and new heights of infection \n-Chicago education collapse \n-No follow up on the origin / cause of Covid.. Who is accountable for this global mess? Too afraid of the truth Mr President?\n-China about to invade Taiwan \n-Sick obsession with sniffing kids hair \n\nSadly this president and friends have acted on trump derangement syndrome rather than the greater good for Americans and the world. It\u2019s just sad. That 1/6 \u201cinsurrection\u201d speech was purely political and was only meant to be divisive. This is the uniting president? No\u2026. He\u2019s just a joke. Literally\u2026 a joke. That was a day that some people believed in something enough to protest and it unfortunately went too far. There\u2019s no conspiracy. So stop contaminating people\u2019s minds with this \u201cinsurrection\u201d rubbish. \n\nNo one takes the old man seriously he\u2019s dodgy and senile; meanwhile China and Russia  are aggressively pushing their agendas knowing America can\u2019t and won\u2019t do anything about it. Biden is weak and so is America while he is in the white-house. We are watching a once \u201cgreat nation\u201d get divided and slip down the drain. The US is no longer the force it once was and absolutely not the leader of the free world anymore. Not even your closest allies have faith anymore. \n\nAll you Trump obsessed democrats; compare Biden\u2019s score sheet to Trump (up to now in their term) CNN can\u2019t re-engineer those facts. Trump was a reasonable president and you will never admit that. You have become paralyzed by an evil form of Atychiphobia when Trump is around. You lose any moral compass and are willing to distort the the truth while killing a great democracy\u2026 It\u2019s about winning power at all costs no matter if America dies. \n\nIt\u2019s so ironic a few years ago the dems fabricated this \u201cRussian collusion\u201d nonesense and completely screwed the government in doing so. Americans suffered the country divided and Trumps term had a cloud over it because of a baseless conspiracy made up by his political opposition. There was constant politically driven impeachment rubbish which did no one any good. Very bitter sentiments were born then and there. Now yes now.. The Russians are actually invading other countries and Biden is turning a blind eye. Seems like Crimea during the Obama era all over again. Funny that! We all know the democrats are the real criminals but constantly use smoke and mirrors in the media to deflect their misdeeds. Look at Joe\u2019s Ukrainian \u201cquid pro quo\u201d- that was actually recorded on video - he boasted about it. Or Obama\u2019s Russian \u201cI\u2019ve got an election coming up\u201d\u2026 Mind blowing stuff!""}",MSNBC,2022-02-10,What The National Archives Found Inside The Boxes Trump Took To Florida,merged,1406529,20202

The world is watching and can see you are totally paralysed with fear of challenging an old norm - charging a President with crimes in office.  A President who openly committed crimes - defined by Muller and all everyone can do is rush around clutching their pearls but doing nothing.  We have been here before at the end of the 19th Century when European aristocracies fell.  They languidly watched - doing nothing - while their world was destroyed by a new sharp middle / business class who were not tied by rules and norms but only defined by money and power.  Chekhov wrote about it in the Cherry Orchard - the aristocracy would go bankrupt rather than have their orchard cut down with it's blossom in the spring.  A property developer came along bought up their mortgages chopped it down and built houses on it.  How could he do such a thing breaking all norms and rules of polite behaviour - he was so vulgar.  Ibsen had a similar man in Ghosts.  The\u00a0Leopard\u00a0by Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa was another that chronicles the changes in Sicilian life and society during the Risorgimento.\u00a0 The sharp little vulgar money making mayor from nowhere - Don Calogero showing up to an aristocratic dinner in the wrong clothes - but he had a beautiful daughter - Angelica !\u00a0 He ends up richer and more powerful that his prince who lives by the unwritten rules of good behaviour !\u00a0\u00a0The old guard - static in fear of their world being destroyed do nothing and watch it go up in flames they just clutch their pearls paralysed that courtesy politeness the norms of good gentlemanly behaviour are trampled on - but they do nothing and their world falls.  Putin is one of these men and looks on from outside - laughing.  His minions and acolytes who hate the old order the Trumps Bannons Cawthorns burrow away from inside destroying the foundations on which the country is built but still those at the top stuck in their aspic can do nothing in total disbelief that it can be happening that anyone could behave in this way.

My question to the public but most of all to the GOP!  You know the GRAND OLD PARTY!!!     They are really quiet right now. They are looking to hide right now. You know like finding a corner in the dark in the back!!! Maybe no one can see them or at least that\u2019s what they are hoping for. My big question is why aren\u2019t we hearing the GOP & his followers. screaming (LOCK HIM UP! LOCK HIM UP!! LOck him up) just amazes me.  I think it\u2019s time for a rally everywhere thru AMERICA & just chant.      (LOCK HIM UP).      Over & over again nothing else!!!We should have known when he was complaining about flushing toilets that it had to do with him!!!     He wasn\u2019t & isn\u2019t worried about wasting water or the water level. Nobody has to flush your toilet 15 times & waste water!   But I guess it might take you 15 flushes if you can\u2019t eat anymore   paper & you go to plan B & try to start flushing TOP SECRET Classified  Government documents. it didn\u2019t belong to him it belongs to the AMERICAN people. How to we know that he doesn\u2019t have or.  had more than 15 boxes at Florida. He could have taken & hidden them at another location??? Who knows??? A big fat CONSPIRACY!!!    He could have more in New York maybe??? But I think we should chant & yell out (LOCK HIM UP) over & over again until the DOJ charges him. I still think he would look good in orange & meet Bubba on his first day @one of the hotels & it won\u2019t be TRUMP TOWERS!!! For stealing (1) piece of any type of government Documents  it\u2019s a federal offense. It\u2019s automatically 3 years each offense in federal prison. So what is 15  boxes & TOP SECRET CLASSIFIED INFO worth??? I wonder if he could count that high? Time will tell !!! I find it ironic that something so stupid would & could get him arrested & put in jail for eating or flushing in the toilets trying to get rid of TOP SECRET CLASSIFIED documents. Tax invasion lying cheating stealing trying screwing with the election (that he didn\u2019t win) & threatening   government officials (I only need 11780 more votes).    & not caring if his goons hung his own  Vice President who stuck by his side except Jan 6 thru thick & thin!!! VP Pence remembered taking his oath about protecting the government & following the Constitution of the United States of America.   I commend Pence for that.       But to be arrested for stealing or destroying government documents. & they aren\u2019t done because he also has missing calls from his call records!!!   Besides he\u2019s known for using other peoples phones. Trying telling him NO you can\u2019t use my phone. He doesn\u2019t & didn\u2019t care if the line was secure Maybe he ate them also! Yahoo! Another day with Donald Trump. It is definitely not boring to say the least!!! He needs an island where he can take his goons & followers & he could be a dictator. & definitely take his GOP to lick his boots & everybody could live happier ever after!!!!!

Is now used to do) in the 2014 Minsk Protocols (Sept. 5) signed by the OSCE (Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe) + Russia + Ukraine (under the mediation of France and Germany within the so-called Normandy Format) that brought PEACE to the region and try to subdue by military force the self-declared independent Donbass an \""independence\"" not recognized by anyone not even by Russia which supports them but at the same time demands them to abide by the Minsk Protocols as Russia itself does.\nTherefore the crisis is NOT between Russia and Ukraine. It is between Russia and the USA (and their puppets NATO and the European Union which is not an exaggeration or intended insult but Political Reality or Realpolitik).\nSo the SOLUTION PEACE in the region is strictly in US hands and can be immediate if POTUS orders it...only he can't.

There was an article about how our banks supports Le Pen in France xDDDDDDDDDDD what a shame :'D  Both Europe and The U.S has a strong economy but dont have natural resources China and Russia has. I think that the former president of the U.S Trump agreed with Putin about the NATO will give up Eastern-European countries (that was USSR members). Putin is working on the resurrection of the USSR because he's fearing that China will one day take back Siberia (ancient chinese land; 50% of the population is Chinese!). To my mind the NATO is not strong enough to repel and / or defend it's members if a war broken out. Putin also wanted to start an another Balkan war (supports Serbia that want to destroy Kosovo and Bosnia). 95% of the population is Kosovo is Albanians who are muslims. Thera are also a huge muslim people / community in Bosnia as well so if Putin wants he can start a religious war between Christianity and Islam! The only was is to send more and more weapons to Ukraine (AT launchers military vehicles guns weapons kevlars helmets AA defense systems etc.) If Ukraine could militarize 5 or 10 something million people with modern weapons then Russia might be not able to destroy Ukraine. Europe and America should relocate each of it's corporations from China to Eastern / Soutern Europe to affect China's economy. But it is very difficult...
