BLM and Antifa are domestic terrorist groups they are the ones cause mayhem and anarchy in the streets. Trump is far from a dictator look back in history Joesph Stalin Hitler Mao Castro these are actual dictators and you will not find a similarity between them and trump. Stop believing this propaganda the dems are using BLM to push their political agenda. BLM is a Marxist group. I can\u2019t believe that almost every single company and sports team and even members of government are supporting this.

I thought they showed up in Portland on July 4th? Am I mistaken in this???  Protesters should try to stay away from federal buildings because this is going to happen every time. Federal troops should not even be in Portland since the city and state did NOT ask them to come in. The president can send them in if federal property is in danger of terrorism but they are only to protect the building and other federal agents not attack PEACEFUL protesters. So stay 2 blocks away. That way DT does not get what he wants violence fear and pain. Protesters can continue to peacefully protest and continue to highlight the necessary changes needed in racial equity. Let the mayor and governor deal with the federal troops. Oh and personally if it were me - I would file a class action lawsuit against the government (DT specifically) for infringement of my right of peaceful protest and free speech. I thought about doing it from here but I am not in a place where this is happening so it would probably get thrown out of the court because I am not DIRECTLY being affected by this.""}",MSNBC,2020-07-26,Rep.

John Lewis stood in front of the cameras and called DT a racist used his position to try and support a coup and did everything he could to undermine the will of the people. There is no reason for DT to pay him respects go to his funeral or spend one moment talking about the old days. So since DT doesn't have to waste his time on this man I will. John Lewis was an empty suit as far as being a legislator is concerned. He got his job because he got a whooping 50+ years ago and finagled himself an easy government job where he didn't have to accomplish ONE thing to better the lives of his constituents. He was an affirmative action representative. He didn't write one piece of meaningful legislation. His district is just as bad now as it was then. He didn't write the things he said in front of the cameras. He was just a DNC puppet who did as he was told voted how he was told said what he was told and when they wanted to play the race card on someone he was one of their go to boys. I'm so over these Maxine Waters Elijah Cummings Sheila Jackson CBC do nothing race hustling DNC stooges. They are nothing but attack dogs for their DNC masters and they have done NOTHING ABSOLUTELY NOTHING to better the lives of my fellow Black folks.
