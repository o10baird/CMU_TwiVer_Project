The BLM riots are the correct comparison; not the single worst acts of mass murder and war on the American people that killed thousands of US civilians and servicemen/women. You realise how many people died as a result of the BLM riots? 25! Not to mention the costs to repair public property and the costs to businesses that were looted.. That was absolutely disgusting but the fools will sweep these events under the carpet because they know the blood is on their hands. The future generations will look back at our generation as being corrupt and delusional. I\u2019m so ashamed. \n\nWhat else? \n\n-Build back better collapse \n-Clearly unwell and senile \n-All-time high in crime nationally. 2021 closed with most homicides ever in history \n-Defund the police \n-Evidence of him and his son doing backhand deals - not to mention the quid pro quo with Ukraine. No surprise Russia sniffing around the border getting ready to invade \n-vaccine mandate will be rejected by high court\n-Afghanistan embarrassment - abandoning your allies like rats. The people who have stood by the US through thick and thin. What a Dog act and a representation of a coward \n-Inflation the worst in 40 years \n-Can\u2019t remember the Australian prime minister name\n-Killed power Independence - fuel prices \n-Ruined relations with France over submarines deal\n-Russian border about irrupt into war and are likely to invade Ukraine & Kazakhstan \n-The US Mexican border is a humanitarian crisis \n-Covid completely unmanaged - no testing kits and new heights of infection \n-Chicago education collapse \n-No follow up on the origin / cause of Covid.. Who is accountable for this global mess? Too afraid of the truth B.randon?\n-China about to invade Taiwan \n\nSadly this president and friends have acted on trump derangement syndrome rather than the greater good for Americans and the world. It\u2019s just sad. That 1/6 \u201cinsurrection\u201d speech was purely political and only meant to be divisive. This is the uniting president? No\u2026. He\u2019s just a joke. Literally\u2026 a joke. \n\nNo one takes this guy (Biden) seriously he\u2019s dodgy and senile; meanwhile China and Russia  are aggressively pushing their agendas knowing America can\u2019t and won\u2019t do anything about it. Biden is weak and so is America while he is in the white-house. We are watching a great nation get divided and slip down the drain. No longer the force it once was and absolutely not the leader of the free world anymore. \n\nAll you Trump deranged democrats that voted for this guy only because your emotions you couldn\u2019t work on the facts - compare Biden\u2019s score sheet to Trump. CNN can\u2019t re-engineer those facts. Trump was a great president and you will never admit that. \n\nIt\u2019s so ironic the dems fabricated this Russian  collusion none sense and completely screwed the government in doing so. Now yes now.. The Russians are invading and Biden is turning a blind eye. We all know the democrats are the real criminals but constantly use smoke and mirrors to deflect their misdeeds. \n\nThe only thing Biden has done is reverse Trump policy when they were the best things going for the US. Go figure???\n\nHow are you not embarrassed? Denial? Trump derangement? \n\nName one good thing this guy has done?

The divergences caused by the \u201cagentur\u201d (agents) of the Illuminati between the British and Germanic Empires will be used to foment this war. At the end of the war Communism will be built and used in order to DESTROY the other governments and TO WEAKEN THE RELIGIONS.\n\nThe Second World War must be fomented by taking advantage of the differences between the Fascists and the political Zionists. This war must be brought about so that Nazism is destroyed and that the political Zionism be strong enough to institute a sovereign state of Israel in Palestine. During the Second World War INTERNATIONAL COMMUNISM must become strong enough in order to balance Christendom which would be then restrained and held in check until the time when we would need it for the FINAL SOCIAL CATACLYSM.\n\nThe Third World War must be fomented by taking advantage of the differences caused by the \u201cagentur\u201d of the \u201cIlluminati\u201d between the political Zionists and the leaders of Islamic World. The war must be conducted in such a way that Islam and political Zionism mutually destroy each other. Meanwhile the other nations once more divided on this issue will be constrained to fight to the point of complete physical moral spiritual and economical exhaustion.\n\nWe shall unleash the Nihilists & the atheists (Russia China) and we shall provoke a formidable social cataclysm which in all its HORROR will show clearly to the nations the effect of absolute atheism origin of savagery and of the most bloody turmoil.\n\nThen everywhere citizens obliged to defend themselves against the world minority of revolutionaries will exterminate those destroyers of civilization and the multitude disillusioned with Christianity whose deistic spirits will from that moment be without compass or direction anxious for an ideal but without knowing where to render its adoration will receive the true light through the universal manifestation of the PURE DOCTRINE OF LUCIFER brought finally out in the PUBLIC view.\n\nThis manifestation will result from the general reactionary movement which will follow the destruction of Christianity and atheism both CONQUERED AND EXTERMINATED at the same time.\u201d\n\n\""That which we must say to the crowd is we worship a god but it is the god one adores without superstition.

When someone is killed or dies while in the commission of a felony they get the murder charges added on as well. why aren't they being charged? WHat would be happening if it had been Hillary or the democrat president and house members who had done these things what is being done?
