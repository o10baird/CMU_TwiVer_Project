Foreign actors and cybercriminals could create new websites change existing websites and create or share corresponding social media content to spread false information in an attempt to discredit the electoral process and undermine confidence in U.S. democratic institutions.\r\n\r\nState and local officials typically require several days to weeks to certify elections\u2019 final results in order to ensure every legally cast vote is accurately counted. The increased use of mail-in ballots due to COVID-19 protocols could leave officials with incomplete results on election night. Foreign actors and cybercriminals could exploit the time required to certify and announce elections\u2019 results by disseminating disinformation that includes reports of voter suppression cyberattacks targeting election infrastructure voter or ballot fraud and other problems intended to convince the public of the elections\u2019 illegitimacy.\r\n\r\nThe FBI and CISA urge the American public to critically evaluate the sources of the information they consume and to seek out reliable and verified information from trusted sources such as state and local election officials. The public should also be aware that if foreign actors or cyber criminals were able to successfully change an election-related website the underlying data and internal systems would remain uncompromised.\r\n\r\nRECOMMENDATIONS\r\nSeek out information from trustworthy sources such as state and local election officials; verify who produced the content; and consider their intent.\r\nVerify through multiple reliable sources any reports about problems in voting or election results and consider searching for other reliable sources before sharing such information via social media or other avenues.\r\nFor information about final election results rely on state and local government election officials.\r\nReport potential election crimes\u2014such as disinformation about the manner time or place of voting\u2014to the FBI.\r\nIf appropriate make use of in-platform tools offered by social media companies for reporting suspicious posts that appear to be spreading false or inconsistent information about election-related problems or results.\r\nThe FBI is responsible for investigating malign foreign influence operations and malicious cyber activity targeting election infrastructure and other U.S. democratic institutions. CISA is responsible for protecting the nation\u2019s critical infrastructure from physical and cyber threats. The FBI and CISA provide services and information to uphold the security integrity and resiliency of the U.S. electoral processes.\r\n\r\nVICTIM REPORTING AND ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\nThe FBI encourages victims to report information concerning suspicious or criminal activity to their local field office (www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices).

Foreign actors and cybercriminals could create new websites change existing websites and create or share corresponding social media content to spread false information in an attempt to discredit the electoral process and undermine confidence in U.S. democratic institutions.\r\n\r\nState and local officials typically require several days to weeks to certify elections\u2019 final results in order to ensure every legally cast vote is accurately counted. The increased use of mail-in ballots due to COVID-19 protocols could leave officials with incomplete results on election night. Foreign actors and cybercriminals could exploit the time required to certify and announce elections\u2019 results by disseminating disinformation that includes reports of voter suppression cyberattacks targeting election infrastructure voter or ballot fraud and other problems intended to convince the public of the elections\u2019 illegitimacy.\r\n\r\nThe FBI and CISA urge the American public to critically evaluate the sources of the information they consume and to seek out reliable and verified information from trusted sources such as state and local election officials. The public should also be aware that if foreign actors or cyber criminals were able to successfully change an election-related website the underlying data and internal systems would remain uncompromised.\r\n\r\nRECOMMENDATIONS\r\nSeek out information from trustworthy sources such as state and local election officials; verify who produced the content; and consider their intent.\r\nVerify through multiple reliable sources any reports about problems in voting or election results and consider searching for other reliable sources before sharing such information via social media or other avenues.\r\nFor information about final election results rely on state and local government election officials.\r\nReport potential election crimes\u2014such as disinformation about the manner time or place of voting\u2014to the FBI.\r\nIf appropriate make use of in-platform tools offered by social media companies for reporting suspicious posts that appear to be spreading false or inconsistent information about election-related problems or results.\r\nThe FBI is responsible for investigating malign foreign influence operations and malicious cyber activity targeting election infrastructure and other U.S. democratic institutions. CISA is responsible for protecting the nation\u2019s critical infrastructure from physical and cyber threats. The FBI and CISA provide services and information to uphold the security integrity and resiliency of the U.S. electoral processes.\r\n\r\nVICTIM REPORTING AND ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\nThe FBI encourages victims to report information concerning suspicious or criminal activity to their local field office (www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices).

Foreign actors and cybercriminals could create new websites change existing websites and create or share corresponding social media content to spread false information in an attempt to discredit the electoral process and undermine confidence in U.S. democratic institutions.\n\n\n\nState and local officials typically require several days to weeks to certify elections\u2019 final results in order to ensure every legally cast vote is accurately counted. The increased use of mail-in ballots due to COVID-19 protocols could leave officials with incomplete results on election night. Foreign actors and cybercriminals could exploit the time required to certify and announce elections\u2019 results by disseminating disinformation that includes reports of voter suppression cyberattacks targeting election infrastructure voter or ballot fraud and other problems intended to convince the public of the elections\u2019 illegitimacy.\n\n\n\nThe FBI and CISA urge the American public to critically evaluate the sources of the information they consume and to seek out reliable and verified information from trusted sources such as state and local election officials. The public should also be aware that if foreign actors or cyber criminals were able to successfully change an election-related website the underlying data and internal systems would remain uncompromised.\n\n\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS\n\nSeek out information from trustworthy sources such as state and local election officials; verify who produced the content; and consider their intent.\n\nVerify through multiple reliable sources any reports about problems in voting or election results and consider searching for other reliable sources before sharing such information via social media or other avenues.\n\nFor information about final election results rely on state and local government election officials.\n\nReport potential election crimes\u2014such as disinformation about the manner time or place of voting\u2014to the FBI.\n\nIf appropriate make use of in-platform tools offered by social media companies for reporting suspicious posts that appear to be spreading false or inconsistent information about election-related problems or results.\n\nThe FBI is responsible for investigating malign foreign influence operations and malicious cyber activity targeting election infrastructure and other U.S. democratic institutions. CISA is responsible for protecting the nation\u2019s critical infrastructure from physical and cyber threats. The FBI and CISA provide services and information to uphold the security integrity and resiliency of the U.S. electoral processes.\n\n\n\nVICTIM REPORTING AND ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\n\nThe FBI encourages victims to report information concerning suspicious or criminal activity to their local field office (www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices).

Foreign actors and cybercriminals could create new websites change existing websites and create or share corresponding social media content to spread false information in an attempt to discredit the electoral process and undermine confidence in U.S. democratic institutions.\n\n\n\nState and local officials typically require several days to weeks to certify elections\u2019 final results in order to ensure every legally cast vote is accurately counted. The increased use of mail-in ballots due to COVID-19 protocols could leave officials with incomplete results on election night. Foreign actors and cybercriminals could exploit the time required to certify and announce elections\u2019 results by disseminating disinformation that includes reports of voter suppression cyberattacks targeting election infrastructure voter or ballot fraud and other problems intended to convince the public of the elections\u2019 illegitimacy.\n\n\n\nThe FBI and CISA urge the American public to critically evaluate the sources of the information they consume and to seek out reliable and verified information from trusted sources such as state and local election officials. The public should also be aware that if foreign actors or cyber criminals were able to successfully change an election-related website the underlying data and internal systems would remain uncompromised.\n\n\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS\n\nSeek out information from trustworthy sources such as state and local election officials; verify who produced the content; and consider their intent.\n\nVerify through multiple reliable sources any reports about problems in voting or election results and consider searching for other reliable sources before sharing such information via social media or other avenues.\n\nFor information about final election results rely on state and local government election officials.\n\nReport potential election crimes\u2014such as disinformation about the manner time or place of voting\u2014to the FBI.\n\nIf appropriate make use of in-platform tools offered by social media companies for reporting suspicious posts that appear to be spreading false or inconsistent information about election-related problems or results.\n\nThe FBI is responsible for investigating malign foreign influence operations and malicious cyber activity targeting election infrastructure and other U.S. democratic institutions. CISA is responsible for protecting the nation\u2019s critical infrastructure from physical and cyber threats. The FBI and CISA provide services and information to uphold the security integrity and resiliency of the U.S. electoral processes.\n\n\n\nVICTIM REPORTING AND ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\n\nThe FBI encourages victims to report information concerning suspicious or criminal activity to their local field office (www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices).

p-qzXO1L92A,"{""commentId"": ""UgwAgToopffOtJthYHp4AaABAg"" ""text"": ""What strikes me is that at its most basic people choose a party that they think will ultimately be best for the country (because amongst other things it also benefits them individually). In other words party and its political philosophy is greater than any one individual leader.  So in a crisis where the country is at risk there is surely in that moment a moral permission to choose a party that best serves to protect the nation's future?\n\nOne would hope that enough moderate Republicans understand this and feel able to vote for Biden to pursue the greater good.  The concern is that tRump has distorted the fundamental political philosophy and morals of the original Republican party effectively making it something else you could say it is now Trumplican.  So a vote for tRump is not a vote for Republicanism in its true form nor is a vote for Biden a vote against it. \n\ntRump thrives on chaos and division and as a result modern political discourse has been tainted by this cancer.  He wants us at eachother's throats and I must admit I have succumbed to such partisanship myself at time.  We need to reject this and simply look at the facts not the propaganda and gaslighting.  No one is a saint and maybe Biden is less than perfect but compared to the lies and corruption the hate and chaos rampant under tRump he is more than qualified to take over as leader and seek to reunite the country. Fundamentally he is a good man despite the smear jobs and he is spreading a message of unity and optimism in his campaign something the country sorely needs in this dark time.  And it should be remembered there is NO historical president for Democratic action in the way tRump suggest will come to pass if Biden is elected because again it is unsubstantiated fear mongering to deflect from tRump's own actions in other words it is projection in its purest form.  As part of that fear mongering the GOP is now trying to tarnish Biden by association but remember the latest Rep led report did NOT find evidence of misdeeds by Hunter no matter the spin (and tRump can't have it both ways saying the Mueller report fully exonerated him when it didn't but claim the present report shows substantial offences by Hunter!). And something else to reflect on was tRump precluded from office due to the dodgy dealings of his siblings and family including Jared's Father's imprisonment and Jared and Ivanka's huge self enrichment from their leveraged deals in China? \n\nWe seem to be suffering from tRump Derangement Syndrome we are burned out by the daily madness and as tRump has wanted we are struggling to see the wood for the trees. This plays into his and Putin's hands and it is only they and the super rich who ultimately benefit.  There is no grand conspiracy of the left in the same way there was no grand conspiracy of the Jews in Hitler's Germany but tRump needs to create a bogeyman for people to be afraid of so as to allow him to undermine institutions and remove civil liberties over time. Make no mistake he doesn't care about the ordinary American even if they are Republican voters he only cares about himself and his avaricious family. He claimed to be a wartime leader but such leaders bring nations together in times of crisis or to fight an enemy in the present case Putin and those who would undermine Democracy the pandemic forest fires and any number of other threats.  But sadly the enemy is within it is tRump's fascist tendencies his need to exercise his deep seated insecurities by crushing all others and installing himself as a dictator.  And amongst other things this has caused tens of thousands of needless deaths due to the gross mishandling of the pandemic. \n\nHis latest quest for chaos is to use classic Nazi propaganda techniques constantly repeating unfounded claim until a portion of the populace believe them unthinkingly namely that mail in voting is corrupt.  But there is absolutely NO evidence of this indeed a Rep led report showed that historically systemic problems with mail in voting is virtually non existent but tRump doesn't care about facts only fear. \n\nTrue Republicanism is antithetical to his quest it is opposed to centralisation of power and increased control the deprivation of civil liberties and for this reason it is not disloyal to vote for Biden because a vote for tRump is not a vote for true Republicanism the Constitution or the future wellbeing of the Nation.""}",MSNBC,2020-09-25,DNC War Room Spokesperson: There Is No One On This Earth & In This Country That Trump Won’t Rip Off,Lily Adams former communications director for Kamala Harris’ presidential campaign criticizes Trump’s selfish actions and defends his niece’s decision to sue the president of defrauding her out of her inheritance Aired on 09/24/2020.» Subscribe to MSNBC: http://on.msnbc.com/SubscribeTomsnbcAbout Deadline White House: Before getting into cable news Nicolle Wallace worked in politics including as President George W.
