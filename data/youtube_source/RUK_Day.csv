Instead of running for the President.  Because without a change in the Republican majority in the Senate if a Democrat is elected as the president then Mc Connell has already signaled that noting and no bills submitted by Democrats will ever be debated or voted on; he is going to block all conservative judges appointments including if a vacancy occurred in the SCOTU .  Therefore knowing this information  why in the heck are the Democrats and Pelosi not focusing on  flipping the Senate and maintaining  the majority in the House.  Focus on asking the question are individuals making more money talking about the negative impact the economic tariffs-taxes have had on the farmers and the cost of food talking about cuts in funding for meals on wheels talking about how Trump  is going to cut money from the social safety net programs (medicare Medicaid and Social Security)   Health insurance is not the only issue.  Ask people is they are okay with Russia currently meddling in our election while the Republicans have block bills-laws to protect our elections. Pelosi needs to make sure daily there are teams of Democrats on the TV online speaking about all these issues and how the Democrats are going to resolve these issues that Republican do give a darn about.  We are hearing nothing to silent while Trump is going to rallies  getting his messages and lies out.  Where are the Democrats counter  ads for every lie Trump is  speaking on twitter media and at his rallies.  This is how to fight to win instead of being quiet and focusing only on one issue when there are many issues impacting our lives.""}",MSNBC,2020-02-22,Nancy Pelosi's Strategy For Getting Democrats To The Polls In November | The 11th Hour | MSNBC,Democrats are looking past their fights with Trump to get voters to the polls in November.

Why have even the democrats given him nearly everything he wants if he is \""Putin's puppet\""? And conveniently Russia favours specifically those candidates whom the establishment does not like...

Since the Russians previously hacked the Electoral College to make Trump President when Hillary had millions more votes - can they ever be trusted again? Are the silly concerns of millions of voters over traditions dating back to such as Tweed-clad Tammany Hall days (now including such as unverifiable untested and privately owned just-created voting apps - and apps referred to as 'tools' to avoid the 'app' word - as well as in various places such as the long-used easily-hacked unverifiable voting machines/vote counters illegal in other countries) obscuring the Russian hysteria?\n\n\u00a0After 'some errors' in the first couple of Dem nominations in great part due to such new introductions were these causing undue concern over nomination volunteers being asked to sign Non-Disclosure Agreements to keep private any other little electoral errors (somehow - quite accidentally - seemingly invariably acting against Bernie Sanders) and merely to protect elections against public concerns about the lack of transparency - and any prospective horror of having their public membership interfering in the privately owned and operated Dem and Repub operations arranging the permissible candidates for the public's political elections? Enquiring minds want to know!\n\n\u00a0Preferably before California where voters and volunteers were revealed as somehow not being publicly and officially informed about rule changes which had the capacity to prevent possibly very high numbers of new/recently moved/now-required picture-ID-with-same-address-as-on-ballot-deficient voters from having a Presidential vote - or about new voting machines with a tendency to clog even with careful handling and with only a limited few among the volunteers being permitted to unclog them guaranteeing lengthy waits likely beyond the capacity of many workers potentially needing several jobs/parents needing to pick up children etc.. 'The Russians!!!' must have been training the trainers - and providing the machines!\n\nhttps://www.wired.com/2016/08/americas-voting-machines-arent-ready-election/\n\n    Author: Brian BarrettBrian Barrett\n    security\n    08.02.16\n \nAmerica\u2019s Electronic Voting Machines Are Scarily Easy Targets\n\n...We\u2019ve previously discussed the sad state of electronic voting machines in America but it\u2019s worth a closer look as we approach election day itself and within the context of increased cyber-hostilities between the US and Russia. Besides by now states have had plenty of warning since a damning report by the Brennan Center for Justice about our voting machine vulnerabilities came out last September. Surely matters must have improved since then.\n\nWell not exactly. In fact not really at all. ...\n\n...The list of those problems is what you\u2019d expect from any computer or more specifically any computer that\u2019s a decade or older. Most of these machines are running Windows XP for which Microsoft hasn\u2019t released a security patch since April 2014. Though there\u2019s no evidence of direct voting machine interference to date researchers have demonstrated that many of them are susceptible to malware or equally if not more alarming a well-timed denial of service attack.\n\n\u201cWhen people think that people think about doing something major to impact our election results at the voting machine they think they\u2019d try to switch results\u201d says Norden referring to potential software tampering. \u201cBut you can do a lot less than that and do a lot of damage\u2026 If you have machines not working or working slowly that could create lots of problems too preventing people from voting at all.\u201d\n\nThe extent of vulnerability isn\u2019t just hypothetical; late last summer Virginia decertified thousands of insecure WinVote machines. As one security researcher described it \u201canyone within a half mile could have modified every vote undetected\u201d without \u201cany technical expertise.\u201d The vendor had gone out of business years prior.\n\nThe WinVote systems are an extreme case but not an isolated one. Other voting machine models have potentially vulnerable wireless components; Virginia\u2019s just the only one where a test proved how bad the situation was.\n\n The worst part about the current state of voting machines is that they don\u2019t even require outside interference to undo an election. \u201cThey\u2019re all computers. They run on tens of thousands of lines of code\u201d says Norden. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible to have a perfectly secure perfectly reliable computer.\u201d\n\nThat's true but in fairness most computers aren't quite this imperfect either.\n\nA Good Kind of Audit\n\nSo electronic voting machines aren\u2019t ideal. The good news is it\u2019s entirely possible to mitigate any potential harm they might cause either by malice or mistake. ...\n..............................................................................................................................................................\n\nWhy should voting information be considered a trade secret of voting machine companies? And why are they all made so easily hackable at source - including new designs for 2020? Do they leave the factory with Russians already installed in cubby-holes within the machines?\n\nhttps://laist.com/2020/01/16/los-angeles-county-voting-system-uncertified.php\n\nLA's New Voting System Is Still Uncertified. Why Election Security Experts Are Worried\nby Libby Denkmann in News on January 16 2020\n\nLos Angeles County is moving full steam ahead with plans to use its new election equipment for the first time in the upcoming presidential primary. ...\n\n...For starters the state has yet to sign off on the new technology \u2014 and it's coming down to the wire: In-person voting begins in six weeks on Feb. 22.\n\nCertification testing has uncovered:\n\n    Dozens of critical user interface and security problems according to recent published reports and conversations with experts.\n    The Secretary of State found vulnerabilities that left the door open to bad actors changing voting data and ultimately the outcome of an election.\n    Testers could also access and alter electronic records and get into physical ballot boxes \u2014 all without detection. \n\nSome candidates for local offices are so disturbed by how ballots appear on the machines that cities like Beverly Hills are exploring lawsuits. ...\n\n... The issues with the actual voting system come at the same time L.A. County is fundamentally changing not just how but where people vote. Many observers are concerned that shift in voting location alone will lead to widespread confusion. ...\n\n... Most places in the U.S. buy their voting equipment from a small number of companies that are only lightly regulated: A 2016 Wharton School report looked at the business of voting technology:\n\nThe industry is dominated by three firms that are moderate in size and neither publicly nor independently held limiting the amount of information available...about their operations and financial performance.\n\nThe guts of these voting machines and their software source code are trade secrets and difficult for governments to examine. All of this is of growing concern for lawmakers especially after Russian efforts to probe U.S. election infrastructure during the 2016 presidential race. CEOs of the big three voting vendors testified about election security for the first time before a House subcommittee last week....\n\n... \""Pre-printed ballots will not be available at vote centers\"" Logan said adding that voters who want to use pen and paper should request a mail-in ballot by Feb. 25.\n\n... Later in the fall the machines were used for the first time in real-world voting during L.A.'s Nov. 5 municipal election. Both the mock elections and the November pilot program were \""unprecedented\"" steps to root out glitches and improve the voting experience according to the Registrar-Recorder's office.\n\nThe state also hired independent testing firms to examine the new voting equipment as part of its certification process.\n\nThat's when the problems started to pop up according to reports published by L.A. County and the Secretary of State.\n\n Continued in reply:\n\n\n(Edited to reduce excess spaces appearing after posting.)""}",MSNBC,2020-02-22,As Putin Meddles In 2020 Bernie Sanders Hits Back And Reveals He Knew Of Operation Before Debate,U.S. Intelligence Officials have briefed President Trump and Bernie Sanders revealing Russia is actively meddling in the 2020 election helping their respective campaigns.

[Brookings]\r\n\r\n--What you need to know: One of the goals of Russian information warfare is to create a society in which we can\u2019t tell the difference between fact and fiction.  \r\n\r\n--The Russian government is becoming more sophisticated in mastering the tools of political warfare for the digital age. This includes the use of bots trolls micro-targeting to spread disinformation.  \r\n\r\n--The strategies are not new but the digital tools are.  \r\n\r\n--Over the next few months we are going to see more disinformation campaigns including fake websites that work together as a network to spread disinformation fake personalities and entities on Twitter and Facebook and manipulation of social media networks\u2019 algorithms including Google YouTube and others. And we\u2019re not really paying enough attention to algorithmic manipulation.  \r\n\r\n--The more frightening development that we are likely to see in the next 12-16 months is the use of artificial intelligence to enhance the tools of political warfare.  \r\n\r\n--Right now humans control and produce online entities like bots and trolls. But soon disinformation campaigns will become more automated smarter and more difficult to detect. AI driven disinformation will be better targeted to specific audiences; AI driven online entities will be able to predict and manipulate human responses; At some point very soon we won\u2019t be able to tell the difference between automated accounts and human entities.  \r\n\r\n--The phenomena of deep fakes\u2014fake video and audio that appears convincingly real \u2013 is going to be used by malicious actors to mislead and deceive us. Debunking this content will be like playing whack-a-mole. This is going to become a reality much sooner than we\u2019re comfortable with.  \r\n\r\n--Democratic societies including the United States can do many things to inoculate themselves against these kinds of tools of political warfare disinformation and cyber-attacks.  \r\n\r\n--Step one is getting the U.S. government to develop a strategy of deterrence when it comes to political warfare.  \r\n\r\n--We currently don\u2019t have such a strategy because we diluted or dissolved the institutions and capabilities we had during the Cold War.  \r\n\r\n--Step two is acknowledging individuals\u2019 responsibility to be more critical consumers of information and recognizing that the information we consume is not neutral but often manipulated by malicious actors.

Edward Griffin from which much can be learned today. His most chilling point was that there's a long-term plan put in play by Russia to defeat America through psychological warfare and \""demoralization\"". It's a long game that takes decades to achieve but it may already be bearing fruit.\r\n\r\n--Bezmenov made the point that the work of the KGB mainly does not involve espionage despite what our popular culture may tell us. Most of the work 85% of it was \""a slow process which we call either ideological subversion active measures or psychological warfare.\""\r\n\r\n--What does that mean? Bezmenov explained that the most striking thing about ideological subversion is that it happens in the open as a legitimate process. \""You can see it with your own eyes\"" he said. The American media would be able to see it if it just focused on it.\r\n\r\n--Bezmenov described this process as \""a great brainwashing\"" which has four basic stages.\r\nThe first stage is called \""demoralization\"" which takes from 15 to 20 years to achieve.\r\nAccording to the former KGB agent that is the minimum number of years it takes to re-educate one generation of students that is normally exposed to the ideology of its country.\r\n\r\n--Bezmenov was also instructed not to waste time with idealistic leftists they would become disillusioned bitter and adversarial when they realized the true nature of Soviet Communism. He discovered that many such were listed for execution once the Soviets achieved control.\r\n\r\n--Bezmenov was encouraged to recruit from large circulation established conservative media rich filmmakers intellectuals cynical and egocentric people who lacked moral principles.\r\n\r\nThe Russians know exactly what kind of people Trump the GOP the Kochs their followers are.\r\n\r\nThe whole process follows 4-steps:\r\n1. Demoralize a nation (15-20 years):Expose your ideology to your nation\u2019s \u201csoft heads\u201d.  At the higher stage the citizens of that country start brainwashing their own countrymen. (The Tea Party and the Trump Supporters) Trump has been discussing the presidency since 1988.\r\n2. Destabilization (2-5 years):  does not care about your patterns.  Essentials are attacked \u2013 Defense Economy and Polity. (Trumpthe GOP and the Kochs are attacking the US)\r\n3. Crisis (6 weeks): bring a country to crisis in such a way that violent change happens which is followed by the next stage. (The Faux Southern Border crisis North Korea Nukes Trump followers creating civil war if Trump impeached)\r\n4. Normalization (infinite period): This is \u201ctongue-in-cheek\u201d and cynical.  Because Normalization means adherence of the enemy country to your own ideology.  The people who were instrumental in bringing the enemy country to this stage are \u201clined up against the wall and shot dead\u201d.""}",MSNBC,2020-02-22,As Putin Meddles In 2020 Bernie Sanders Hits Back And Reveals He Knew Of Operation Before Debate,U.S. Intelligence Officials have briefed President Trump and Bernie Sanders revealing Russia is actively meddling in the 2020 election helping their respective campaigns.

Who are playing the same game of playing whatever tune they think you want to hear. Throwing things to see if they stick. And when something does stick and someone asks about it. They have to come up with responses on the spot. As they don't know what they're talking about. They're just dangling carrots to get your votes.\n\nTheir purpose to get elected has nothing to do with YOU! Except like a vampire sees you as a source of blood they see you as a source of votes (they're predators). Their agenda is not to improve your way of life! As for Sanders he has never deviated from his mission. That we ALREADY have the funds for a fair way of life in America. We got to eliminate misspending!\n\nI know the truth about Bernie Sanders honor ethics and moral dedication to the country. So all these false accusations attacks and fabrications. Will not sway me as they can not alter the facts. As no one can alter the past. And none of these negative things they say ever happened! \n\nHere are detailed policies not thrown together. Unlike other candidates. https://berniesanders.com/issues/\n\nVote for Bernie Sanders knowing. After The Motley Crue has evacuated the White House. Bernie will have to reassemble the government. As it's kept being dismantled by the Trump Administration.\n\nVote for Bernie knowing. They're systems in place that will block his every decision. Becoming President will be only the beginning. Think about that! Who is the one person qualified?\n\nKnowing this vote for the one guy that has the will to fight and not buckle. Nor ever sell out! And has gone into this with selfless intentions.\n\nFor Vote By Mail contact your County Clerk for information. Vote early. If you're Republican voting for Sanders and don't want to vote as a Democrat. You can find out what you can vote for in your State as an NPP (No Party Preference).

The security state wants voters to believe Bernie supporters are NOT only bullies they\u2019re Russian bots.\n\nThese guiley ghouls will attempt to convince voters a capitalist oligarchical Russia desires that a Democratic socialist sit in the Oval Office. Voters would need to suspend all logical thinking in order to accept this delusional narrative. In other words the security state wants the public to believe Bernie\u2019s popularity and significant lead is somehow related to Putin\u2019s meddling.\n\nThe security state has laid the perfect trap\u2013If Bernie denies the intelligence agencies revelations the mainstream media news will compare Bernie to the Buffoon. They\u2019ll go on incessantly about how Putin has found a new bromance. However if Bernie goes along with the Russophobic hysteria he\u2019s perceived as a silly Biden-like brain dead tool of the security state. In short he\u2019s viewed as a weak politician who could be fooled into military interventions. This look is extremely unappealing to antiwar progressives.\n\nThe reenergizing of Russophobia is the perfect booby-trap. Bernie is damned if he doesn\u2019t go along with the intelligence agencies and is damned if he does.\n\nNevertheless if a politician is approaching 80 and knows this moment is his last chance at the presidential dance a spiritual boldness should emerge. He should NOT take the Corbyn route and be stymied by his foes but move full force against venomous assailants by just merely speaking the truth.\n\nSay you\u2019re winning because the working-class and the young are living hopeless debt ridden lives. Say you\u2019re winning because more than 80 million lack decent healthcare. Say you\u2019re winning because 500000 homeless and many more millions are on the verge of living on the streets.

First they deny the reality that China is a Communist dictatorship run without the consent of its people and that what popular legitimacy it does have comes partly as a product of how it has degraded said people.

The DNC changes rules mid-stream to get Bloomberg in to muck things up in a brokered Convention that would work against Bernie. The Super delegates will now weigh in on the first ballot instead of the second as was originally agreed upon. \n     Bloomberg makes the silliest attack on Bernie for having 3 homes without knowing the facts that Senators have to have 2 homes and Bernie's fabulous vacation home is a little cabin his wife inherited from her parents while Bloomberg announces he has only one home in NYC. So true but he also has 3 in the Hamptons 1 in Florida  1 in Bermuda and another in London several others for a total of 14. A photo spread of his London home  in Town and Country shows  a palace worthy of the Sultan of Brunei. I'm sure his other properties are equally opulent. \n     Then there is the business of the Bernie Bros. MSM loves that myth. Bloomberg jumped on the band wagon today with the announcement that one of his campaign offices was vandalized and he thinks the Bernie Bros did it. Sure why not. Everyone is piling on Bernie.  He has become the silver crucifix in the face of the vampire to the power brokers who control this country right now.\n      Meanwhile they completely ignore the latest independent study out of Yale which proves that MEDICARE FOR ALL will save many billions of dollars yearly save lives and promote better outcomes for the people and there is absolutely no reason why we can't do it but for the special interests that control the health care in this country. A must see video explains it all: https://youtu.be/KxWdsEq_514. One you'll never see on MSM because it proves that Bernie is right. \n     Heaven forbid we have one of those in the Oval Office. Someone who's agenda will work for the people while giving the Status Quo heartburn and what amounts to a few more dollars to the IRS.

That is threatening the national security at its core. Trump is doing exactly what Putin wants him to do willingly or unwillingly. Barr should be indicted as well quickly.

There\u2019s no effective difference between a fascist autocracy and organised crime. \n\n2. Freedom and prosperity do not come from the spectacle of bending the law to the will of those in power enforcing fealty and dependence in those who have little power.  That kind of broken system can be seen in many other places around the world.  \n\n\n\n3. This demonstrates the republican party have been groomed into collaborating with and enabling a criminal autocratic regime in America. The proof can be seen in broad daylight which is why its normally referred to as \u201ccommitting crime in plain sight\u201d.\n\n\n\n4.

Yes people really are that shallow. Outside of the fact that trump has no polished character such as an Ivy League law school graduate he is just the same as what has come before him. trump might be inferior intellectually.  Tolstoy said \""Kings are the slaves of history: and I believe him.\n\nTrump grew up with a rich daddy who took care of him through all Trump's bankruptcies. Now Trump has daddy Putin who is worth a reported $200 Billion (stolen from the Russian people). Trump is like a baby bird when it comes to $$$$...Its obvious German bank  puntin trumps new sugar daddy's\n\nPeople like Brennan should state it more clearly:  Trump is a TRAITOR he is obviously working AGAINST the interests of the United States and its people.  Trump is a TRAITOR!!!...The vote will be clear this November: Vote Red for Russia or Vote True American BLUE\u2026\""You can ignore reality.

There were still honourable men prepared to defend the country.  The current Democrat defense of the country is seen as treasonous and unpatriotic by over one third of the population.   Even in his presidential campaign Trump had already subverted the government by making deals with Russia as regards lifting or relaxing bans imposed by the Obama presidency. In announcing his cabinet Trump imported all his cronies and others intent on criminal or self serving purposes.  Rex Tillerson accepted a posting as being an Exxon executive he had completed a half-billion dollar fuel contract with Russia.  Obviously he assumed that Trump would lift the restrictions on trade with Russia.  When the bans were not lifted Tillerson was gone.  Most of the original cabinet have been fired or resigned under a cloud of disgrace.  Most of the Trump executive positions are held by acting heads of departments as Trump seemingly cannot attract \""the best people\"".  Along came Mnuchin who had a financial arrangement with a Russian oligarch.  He subverted the treasury department.  Along came a series of corrupt attorney-generals culminating in Barr who like his predecessor Matt Whittaker totally capitulated to Trump's demands.  Who would have thought that Jeff Sessions would turn out to be the only cabinet member with a sense of decency. Finally the fly in the ointment deputy AG Rosenstein who steered the Mueller probe into oblivion while outwardly appearing to be a non partisan career officer.  When you are convinced that we have reached rock bottom a new scandal sees us heading further downward.  Soon the hole will be so deep that we will not see daylight above and the darkness will seem normal.\n\nHere's hoping that the Democrats retake the presidency and the Senate because the first order of business should be to impeach every member of the House and Senate that didn't respect their Oath of Office and the Rule of Law and Aided and Abetted Trumpty Dumpty's corrupt administration\u2026 The rest of the World views Trump as being the Villain of the World!

Barr is launching investigations and threatening criminal prosecution of anyone daring to \n      investigate Russian interference.  \n2.   McConnell is blocking every single bill to ensure election security from coming to the Senate floor \n       for a vote.  The same McConnell who got $1.5M campaign contribution from Putin\u2019s pal Blavatnik.\n3.    Trump has sacked anyone from the Intelligence services who dares to brief the intelligence \n       committee about Russian interference.   And just in case Russia was still finding interference \n       difficult\n4.    Trump appoints a completely unqualified completely inexperienced Director of Intelligence.  But \n       then what qualifications do you need to look the other way and ignore anything Trump doesn\u2019t want \n       to hear.\n\nAs he has done all of his entitled spoilt brat life Trump puts his interests first.  Who cares if the rights of \u201cwe the people\u201d to chose our president is handed over to a foreign entity - as long as that foreign entity will keep Trump in power for their own purposes.   And rather than defend our constitutional rights the integrity of our elections  and the safety and well-being of the country Trump is doing everything possible to ensure the door is left wide open for a repeat performance by Putin in 2020 just for his own self- interests.   After all the presidency is proving to be an endless money pit for Trump and his grifter family.  Not to mention the small detail that no longer being president would leave him wide open for investigations and indictments - and Barr won\u2019t be there to close down any awkward investigations or tweak the judiciary system for those found guilty of criminal enterprize on Trump\u2019s behalf.  \n\nNo wonder Republicans refused to put the interests of the country first and piously claimed it should be down to \u201cwe the people\u201d to decide.   They know darn well that they\u2019ve handed that power over to try to ensure the 2020 election is anything but fair.\n\nNo matter how many times Trump hugs the flag he\u2019s no patriot.  If his own interests conflict with what\u2019s best for the country then the country will come a very poor second.""}",MSNBC,2020-02-22,Rep.

hHAI-w5PnkM,"{""commentId"": ""Ugz9bTsKphG-bRibcZJ4AaABAg"" ""text"": ""The question every American should be asking is why do republicans continue to block election security bills?\u00a0 Senate Republicans blocked 3 election security bills just last week. \n\nIt's becoming abundantly clear that Trump and republicans are now owned by Russians. They receive their funding from Russians and then they receive their marching orders from Russians. That's how it works whenever you've been completely bought and paid for and fully compromised.\n\nLev Parnas the indicted associate of Rudy received a $1 million payment from Russia and tried to hide it from investigators prosecutors have now stated. Trump denies knowing Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman even though they have attended events at his properties and they have posed in multiple photos with Trump.\n\nParnas who was charged with illegally funneling foreign cash to Republican politicians including a pro-Trump super PAC received $1 million from a mysterious account in Russia in September which he conveniently forgot disclose to the government.\n\nLev Parnas paid Rudy $500000. The mysterious payment from Russia should not be a surprise considering that all roads lead to Putin and Russia when it comes to Trump. \n\nProsecutors say Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman donated larger sums of money to Republicans in an effort to enlist them in their effort to oust then-Ukraine Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch who\u00a0testified\u00a0that she was recalled after a smear campaign by Rudy. Along with their work with Rudy Parnas and Fruman are\u00a0accused of meeting\u00a0at Trump\u2019s Washington hotel to discuss a Ukraine gas deal linked to Yovanovitch\u2019s removal.\n\nParnas was throwing Russian money at Republicans like beads at Mardi Gras to any republican that was willing to expose themselves to him. A handful of Republican campaign committees received nearly $500000 from\u00a0Parnas and Fruman..\n\nProsecutors say that\u00a0they \u201cconspired to circumvent the federal laws against foreign influence\u00a0by engaging in a scheme to funnel foreign money to candidates for federal and state office so that the defendants could buy potential influence with candidates campaigns and the candidates\u2019 governments.\u201d\n\nIn 2018 Parnas and Fruman donated directly to Texas GOP Rep. Pete Sessions. Fruman also\u00a0gave to\u00a0SC. GOP Rep. Joe Wilson\u00a0and\u00a0to a joint fundraising committee\u00a0tied to\u00a0Florida\u00a0Gov.\u00a0Rick Scott\u00a0in his successful bid for Senate. Both Sessions and Wilson have acknowledged meeting with both men.\u00a0\n\nFruman and Parnas also gave to other joint fundraising committees which drew more\u00a0GOP lawmakers. FEC records show that 22 other Republicans who were lawmakers at the time received contributions from Fruman who misspelled his last name as \u201cFurman\u201d in filings in \u201ca further effort to hide the source of the funds and to evade federal reporting requirements\u201d according to the indictment..""}",MSNBC,2020-02-22,Rep.

hHAI-w5PnkM,"{""commentId"": ""UgwpfyXz4FoCQqwjlyV4AaABAg"" ""text"": ""Republicans have created an America of corporations\u00a0 by corporations and for corporations. We the people have been officially replaced by Citizens United a ruling placed on us by Republicans which is designed to rule over us.\n\nRepublican campaign finance reports which are available to the public show connections between a group of wealthy donors with ties to Russia and their political contributions to Trump and a number of top Republican leaders. And thanks to changes in campaign finance laws the political contributions are legal. Bottom line\u00a0 our campaign finance laws are now a threat to our country.\n\nLen Blavatnik is a dual U.S.-U.K. citizen and one of the largest donors to GOP political action committees in the 2015-16 election cycle. Blavatnik's family emigrated to the U.S. in the late '70s from the the Soviet Union and he returned to Russia when the Soviet Union began to collapse in the late '80s.\n\nIn 2015-16 Blavatnik's political contributions soared as he pumped $6.35 million into GOP political action committees with millions of dollars going to top Republican leaders including Moscow Mitch Rubio and Lindsey \""Two-faced\"" Graham. \n\nOleg Deripaska\u00a0is said to be one of Putin's favorite oligarchs and he is founder and majority shareholder of Russia's Rusal the second-largest aluminum company in the world. Blavatnik holds a stake in Rusal with a business partner.\n\nWe already know that Manafort Trump's former campaign manager began collecting $10 million a year in 2006 from Oleg Deripaska to advance Putin's interests with Western governments. Deripaska's name turned up again in an email handed over to Mueller's team by Manafort's attorneys.\u00a0In the email dated July 7 2016 just two weeks before Trump accepted the Republican nomination Manafort asked an overseas intermediary to pass a message on to Deripaska: \""If he Deripaska needs private briefings tell him we can accommodate.\""\n\nMoscow Mitch knew from receiving intelligence briefings in 2016 that our electoral process was under attack by the Russians. Two weeks after the Dept of Homeland Security and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence issued a joint statement in October 2016 that the Russian government had directed the effort to interfere in our electoral process Moscow Mitch's PAC accepted a $1 million donation from Blavatnik's AI-Altep Holdings. The PAC took another $1 million from Blavatnik's AI-Altep Holdings on March 30 2017 just 10 days after former Comey publicly testified before the House Intelligence Committee about Russia's interference in the election.\n\nThe contributions are legal because the Supreme Court's 2010 ruling Citizens United allowed American corporations to give unlimited amounts of money to PACs regardless of how they make their money where they make their money or with whom they make their money. \n\nThe man who led the winning fight for Citizens United was David Bossie president of the conservative non-profit since 2001. Bossie served as Trump's deputy campaign chairman.\n\nThe Super PAC Make America Number 1 is funded by Trump's largest donor Robert Mercer. His Renaissance Technologies hedge fund donated $15.5 million to the PAC.\n\nMercer's daughter Rebekah assumed control of Make America Number 1 in September 2016 and is now tainted by her role in the communications between Wikileaks and Cambridge Analytica the firm that Jared Kushner hired for $5.9 million to handle the digital portion of the Trump campaign...\n\nCitizens United must be overturned. It represents the biggest crime ever perpetrated on the American people. It was created by republicans and powerful corporations for the sole purpose of finally controlling our government for their own financial gains all while undermining the will of the people..""}",MSNBC,2020-02-22,Rep.

Just a few minutes ago I was truly wondering what\nhas become of the country I grew up in served for 20 years and love. People\ndidn't want to believe that Nixon's regime was corrupt but as more and more\nevidence surfaced to prove them wrong the country got behind the calls for his\nremoval. The more evidence that surfaces here the more people get behind the\ncorrupt regime. I have experienced the murder of a President the Civil Rights\nmovement the murder of that movement's leader the murder of a Presidential\nCandidate the resignation of a THOROUGHLY corrupt President AND his Vice\nPresident the ridiculousness of an Impeachment of the president for lying\nabout an affair and the fulfillment of the American Dream for every Black\nPerson in this country. However I NEVER EVER thought I would see the\ndismantling of our Democracy. This is just sad on too many levels to even\nconsider.\n\n\nBarr must be disbarred from the bar\u2026 BILL droopy BARR\nMUST RESIGN!!!\u00a0\u00a0 We need to get rid of\nthat lying psychopath as well.\u00a0 I surely\nwish more responsible patriots would stand up for America please remember all\nthe young lives that were lost believing in America\u2026Trump\u2019s 29 trips (including\nthis past weekend) to Mar-a-Lago brings golf tab to 334 years in presidential\nsalary that\u2019s more criminal Presidential SALARY than all the other Presidents\nput together even with adjusting for inflation. This is proudly sponsored by\nall those MAGA hat wearers who voted for this criminal POS. Thanks @ss hole!...\nWell it was a big thing.... politicians actually respecting their oath of\noffice and facing down the President.

gqDa-Igwfqw,"{""commentId"": ""UgxDZ9TwGeXjuwtwMdR4AaABAg"" ""text"": ""Republicans have created an America of corporations\u00a0 by corporations and for corporations. We the people have been officially replaced by Citizens United a ruling placed on us by Republicans which is designed to rule over us.\n\nRepublican campaign finance reports which are available to the public show connections between a group of wealthy donors with ties to Russia and their political contributions to Trump and a number of top Republican leaders. And thanks to changes in campaign finance laws the political contributions are legal. Bottom line\u00a0 our campaign finance laws are now a threat to our country.\n\nLen Blavatnik is a dual U.S.-U.K. citizen and one of the largest donors to GOP political action committees in the 2015-16 election cycle. Blavatnik's family emigrated to the U.S. in the late '70s from the the Soviet Union and he returned to Russia when the Soviet Union began to collapse in the late '80s.\n\nIn 2015-16 Blavatnik's political contributions soared as he pumped $6.35 million into GOP political action committees with millions of dollars going to top Republican leaders including Moscow Mitch Rubio and Lindsey \""Two-faced\"" Graham. \n\nOleg Deripaska\u00a0is said to be one of Putin's favorite oligarchs and he is founder and majority shareholder of Russia's Rusal the second-largest aluminum company in the world. Blavatnik holds a stake in Rusal with a business partner.\n\nWe already know that Manafort Trump's former campaign manager began collecting $10 million a year in 2006 from Oleg Deripaska to advance Putin's interests with Western governments. Deripaska's name turned up again in an email handed over to Mueller's team by Manafort's attorneys.\u00a0In the email dated July 7 2016 just two weeks before Trump accepted the Republican nomination Manafort asked an overseas intermediary to pass a message on to Deripaska: \""If he Deripaska needs private briefings tell him we can accommodate.\""\n\nMoscow Mitch knew from receiving intelligence briefings in 2016 that our electoral process was under attack by the Russians. Two weeks after the Dept of Homeland Security and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence issued a joint statement in October 2016 that the Russian government had directed the effort to interfere in our electoral process Moscow Mitch's PAC accepted a $1 million donation from Blavatnik's AI-Altep Holdings. The PAC took another $1 million from Blavatnik's AI-Altep Holdings on March 30 2017 just 10 days after former Comey publicly testified before the House Intelligence Committee about Russia's interference in the election.\n\nThe contributions are legal because the Supreme Court's 2010 ruling Citizens United allowed American corporations to give unlimited amounts of money to PACs regardless of how they make their money where they make their money or with whom they make their money. \n\nThe man who led the winning fight for Citizens United was David Bossie president of the conservative non-profit since 2001. Bossie served as Trump's deputy campaign chairman.\n\nThe Super PAC Make America Number 1 is funded by Trump's largest donor Robert Mercer. His Renaissance Technologies hedge fund donated $15.5 million to the PAC.\n\nMercer's daughter Rebekah assumed control of Make America Number 1 in September 2016 and is now tainted by her role in the communications between Wikileaks and Cambridge Analytica the firm that Jared Kushner hired for $5.9 million to handle the digital portion of the Trump campaign...\n\nCitizens United must be overturned. It represents the biggest crime ever perpetrated on the American people. It was created by republicans and powerful corporations for the sole purpose of finally controlling our government for their own financial gains all while undermining the will of the people..""}",MSNBC,2020-02-22,Republicans Mail Out Fake Census Documents | All In | MSNBC,The Republican Party is still trying to undermine a fair accounting of the population.

There were still honourable men prepared to defend the country.  The current Democrat defense of the country is seen as treasonous and unpatriotic by over one third of the population.   Even in his presidential campaign Trump had already subverted the government by making deals with Russia as regards lifting or relaxing bans imposed by the Obama presidency. In announcing his cabinet Trump imported all his cronies and others intent on criminal or self serving purposes.  Rex Tillerson accepted a posting as being an Exxon executive he had completed a half-billion dollar fuel contract with Russia.  Obviously he assumed that Trump would lift the restrictions on trade with Russia.  When the bans were not lifted Tillerson was gone.  Most of the original cabinet have been fired or resigned under a cloud of disgrace.  Most of the Trump executive positions are held by acting heads of departments as Trump seemingly cannot attract \""the best people\"".  Along came Mnuchin who had a financial arrangement with a Russian oligarch.  He subverted the treasury department.  Along came a series of corrupt attorney-generals culminating in Barr who like his predecessor Matt Whittaker totally capitulated to Trump's demands.  Who would have thought that Jeff Sessions would turn out to be the only cabinet member with a sense of decency. Finally the fly in the ointment deputy AG Rosenstein who steered the Mueller probe into oblivion while outwardly appearing to be a non partisan career officer.

I wish the Canadian Border Patrol would screen Americans on IQ and EQ because we do not want them diluting the Canadian Gene Pool.
